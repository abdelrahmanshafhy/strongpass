            The STRONGPASS website provides you with security by giving you a
            unique<br />and secure password.<br />
            <br />
            You can also filter your password by specifying the elements that the
            password contains from<br />
            uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers and symbols.<br />
            <br />
            This provides more security for the user.

            <h4>Hard to hack:</h4>
            <br />
            Hackers always seek to hack and steal accounts for different
            purposes.<br />
            <br />
            In order for the hacker to hack your account through the e-mail, but
            some people think that<br />giving the e-mail to anyone will not harm,
            but this person may be a hacker and through<br />his knowledge of the
            e-mail he can guess your password.<br />
            <br />
            But some ask how hackers can guess the password?<br />
            <br />
            The answer, simply, is that by knowing your date of birth, your name,
            your address,<br />or the thing you love, he can guess your password.<br />
            <br />
            So you should create a password that is not linked to anything in your
            life or something<br />you know or use a lot.

        <p>
            And now you definitely need tips to avoid the problem of hacking and
            theft of accounts, data and personal
            <br />information:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Try to choose a strong password, for example, that contains uppercase
                and lowercase letters, numbers and<br />
                symbols.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                Make sure the person you are sending the email to has personal
                information.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                Try to avoid questionable sites and unknown shopping sites and not to
                enter account information or
                <br />banking information (credit card information).
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                Avoid sites that say you won a phone or a car because they are mostly
                hacker pages to let you enter your<br />data to steal it.<br />
                <br />
                When you enter the websites of movies and series, sometimes pages are
                opened that require you to<br />
                enter your data for different reasons, so try to avoid these things
                and do not fall into the hands of the<br />
                hacker.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                Sometimes hackers resort to the idea of hacking through emails.<br />
                Because by opening the message, you are allowing and giving permission
                to the hacker to be able to<br />
                successfully complete the hack.<br />
                <br />
                Because the message is just a way to reach you.<br />
                <br />
                So always check the messages before opening them and also check the
                source of the message.<br />
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                Beware of Wi-Fi networks in the streets and public places, because
                sometimes they are under<br />
                the control of an intruder.<br />
                <br />
                When you connect to these networks, you allow the hacker to take
                control of your phone and gain access<br />
                to your personal information.<br />
                <br />
                And always make sure to download security and protection software and
                activate the firewall.<br />
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                But you should also pay attention when you enter websites, pay
                attention to the icons next to the domain<br />
                name.<br />
                As you can see in the following table, these codes are safe, unsafe,

                So be aware of websites before entering your information such as
                email, password and credit card<br />
                information.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
            And now you are definitely wondering how I can act if my device or my
            account has been hacked.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                First, keep your connection to the Internet as short as possible so
                that the hacker cannot access the<br />
                rest of the information.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>Secondly, download protection programs and encryption programs.</li>
            <br />
            <li>
                Third, contact the protection companies and people who specialize in
                this field and have high knowledge<br />
                of these matters.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                Fourth, visit the nearest phone repair shop because they have enough
                experience in dealing with these<br />
                matters.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                Fifthly, watch videos to help you solve this problem.<br /><br />
                Do a Google search for solutions to this problem and focus on the
                experiences of the people behind this<br />
                topic.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                Finally, after restoring your data, format your device or perform a
                factory reset.<br /><br />
                And if you do not know how to do a hard reset or factory reset, go to
                the nearest electronics store and<br />
                there you will find someone who can do that for you.<br /><br />
                There are also programs dedicated to these matters, which is a
                somewhat easier way.
